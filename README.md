# Sales Prediction and Retail Data Analysis

This repository contains files related to sales prediction and retail data analysis using machine learning models. The dataset used in these analyses includes the following files:

 1. melb_data.csv
   - This file contains data related to Melbourne housing, which may be used for various data analysis or machine learning tasks.

2. train.csv
   - The training dataset used for developing machine learning models.

3. Decision_Tree_Regression_Model
   - A Jupyter Notebook created using Colaboratory that demonstrates the implementation of a Decision Tree Regression model for retail data analysis. It is used for predicting sales based on the provided data.

4. Retail_Data_Analysis_using_Random_Forest_ML_Model
   - Another Jupyter Notebook created using Colaboratory that focuses on retail data analysis using a Random Forest machine learning model.

5. Sales_Prediction_using_DecisionTreeRegressor_Model
   - A Jupyter Notebook created using Colaboratory that specifically targets sales prediction using a Decision Tree Regressor model.

## Usage

- `Decision_Tree_Regression_Model.ipynb` and `Sales_Prediction_using_DecisionTreeRegressor_Model.ipynb` provide examples of how to use machine learning models for sales prediction.

- `Retail_Data_Analysis_using_Random_Forest_ML_Model.ipynb` focuses on retail data analysis using a Random Forest machine learning model.
